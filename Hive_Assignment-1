QUE 1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv
ANS. Data has been downloaded and stored as CSV file format.

QUE 2. Store raw data into hdfs location
ANS. mv sales_order_data_csv.csv /user/hive/warehouse/student_hive/

QUE 3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table


create table sales_order_data_csv
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
stored as textfile
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1"); 

QUE 4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

load data inpath 'file:///tmp/student_hive/sales_order_data_csv.csv' into table sales_order_data_csv;

que 5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

create table sales_order_data_orc
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
stored as orc;


QUE 6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

from sales_order_data_csv insert overwrite table  sales_order_data_orc select *;


# Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculate total sales per year
select year_id, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_data_orc group by year_id; 

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
select productline, max(orderlinenumber) from sales_order_data_orc group by productline;


c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
select qtr_id, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum
select qtr_id, min(sales) as minimum_sales from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id;

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
select country, max(sales) as maximum_sales, min(sales) as minimum_sales from sales_order_orc group by country;

f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
select city, sum(sales) as quartely_sales from sales_order_orc group by city;

h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
select year_id, month_id, max(quantityordered) from sales_order_orc group by year_id;
